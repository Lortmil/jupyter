    "Canada has produced cheese since the early 1600s. French settlers brought cattle from Normandy and over time the Norman cows were bred to produce the Canadienne breed[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Canadian cheese comes in many forms and flavours. Milk from cows, goats, and sheep are used to make some very tasty products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fat content in cheese plays a crucial role in determining its flavor, texture, nutritional value, and culinary applications. Different levels of fat content can cater to various preferences and dietary needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fat in cheese is important for people who have cardiovascular concerns, the saturated fat content in cheese may be a consideration. Lower-fat cheese options are available for those seeking to reduce their fat intake. Additonally, fat content of cheese can also be related to its lactose content. Harder, aged cheeses with higher fat content often have lower lactose levels, making them more suitable for people with lactose intolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Culinary uses of cheese range from a simple slice of provolone on a sandwich to cacio de pepe, where it is melted as part of a sauce. Fat affects how the cheese melts as higher-fat cheeses tend to melt more smoothly and evenly, making them ideal for sauces, fondues, and toppings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will be looking in to fat content. What are the factors that lead to the fat content in cheese? Can we predict the fat content? Knowing these factors can help consumers and commercial enterprises make choices for the cheese they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use machine learning regression techniques to train a model, with the best paramters, to produce a tool to predict fat content in cheese based on data such as the animal that produced the milk, the province where the cheese was produced, and whether it was produced organically."

    "In order to follow the Golden Rule where test data cannot influence the training model. We will need to split the data in to test dataframes and training data frames. Splitting the data into training and test sets ensures that the model is trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on another. This helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data, mimicking real-world scenarios. Setting a random state parameter ensures that the data splitting is consistent across multiple runs. This makes the results reproducible, which is important for debugging, comparing different models, and validating results."
